# 2048_nn_ga
Experiment on genetic algorithm for generating neural network for playing 2048

TLDR: it wasn't successful :) 

In first main step I tried to gather a train set of best moves - moves from best NNs that was generated by GA. Then, at the second phase, I was triyng to fit Keras NN on this set. There are many helper function to imitate 2048 game - you can even play it in console!
